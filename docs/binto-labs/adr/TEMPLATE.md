## Notes for Using This Template

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Making architectural decisions that affect system design
- Choosing between significant alternatives (frameworks, patterns, technologies)
- Establishing standards or conventions
- Making decisions that are hard/expensive to reverse
- Documenting decisions made during SPARC Architecture phase

### How to Use with Claude-Flow

**During SPARC workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run SPARC Architecture phase (stores decisions in memory)
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Your architectural task" \
  --strategy development \
  --sparc \
  --quality-threshold 0.90

# Step 2: After Architecture phase completes, create ADR
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Create ADR from memory key 'architecture/*' using template docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md" \
  --agents api-docs,system-architect

# Step 3: Review and commit
git add docs/adr/XXX-*.md
git commit -m "docs: Add ADR-XXX for [decision]"
```

### ADR Numbering

- Use sequential numbers: 001, 002, 003, etc.
- Include number in filename: `001-short-title.md`
- Reference ADRs by number: "As documented in ADR-003..."

### Status Lifecycle

```
üîµ Proposed ‚Üí üü° In Review ‚Üí ‚úÖ Accepted ‚Üí [üì¶ Deprecated | üîÑ Superseded]
                ‚Üì
              ‚ùå Rejected
```

### Quality Scores (Claude-Flow Specific)

If using claude-flow verification system, include:
- **design-validation:** 0-1.0 (how well the design meets requirements)
- **scalability-check:** 0-1.0 (can it handle growth?)
- **pattern-compliance:** 0-1.0 (follows best practices?)
- **Overall threshold:** Usually 0.90 for production decisions

### Tips

1. **Be concise:** ADRs are decision records, not design docs
2. **Be specific:** Include actual code/config examples where relevant
3. **Show alternatives:** Document why you chose A over B
4. **Link liberally:** Reference related ADRs, docs, code
5. **Update status:** Keep the Status field current
6. **Immutable:** Don't edit accepted ADRs - create new ones that supersede them
