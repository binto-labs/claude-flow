## Agent Coordination Requirements

### SPARC Workflow
Each documentation task should follow SPARC:
1. **Specification:** Analyze existing docs + source code to understand feature
2. **Pseudocode:** Outline documentation structure and key examples
3. **Architecture:** Design documentation flow and diagram layouts
4. **Refinement:** Write documentation with verified code examples
5. **Completion:** Review against quality standards, cross-link with other docs

### Quality Verification
Each document must pass:
- **accuracy-check:** All code examples verified against source
- **completeness-check:** All key areas covered
- **clarity-check:** Understandable by target audience
- **consistency-check:** Matches MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md style

### Memory Coordination
Store progress in memory:
- `docs/progress/[topic]` - Current status
- `docs/examples/[topic]` - Verified code examples
- `docs/diagrams/[topic]` - ASCII diagrams
- `docs/review/[topic]` - Review feedback
