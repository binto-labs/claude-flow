## üîë Critical Insights from Investigation

### 1. Command ‚Üí Agent Mapping Flow
**Located:** ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE.md Part 1

Claude-flow builds an 800+ line structured prompt based on:
- Strategy selection (auto, research, development, analysis, testing, optimization, maintenance)
- Mode configuration (centralized, distributed, hierarchical, mesh, hybrid)
- Agent recommendations (specific to strategy)
- SPARC methodology integration (for development/auto strategies)

### 2. Architecture Alignment via Evals
**Located:** ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE.md Part 3

Architect agents have THREE required verification checks:
1. **design-validation** - Validates architectural decisions
2. **scalability-check** - Validates scaling plans
3. **pattern-compliance** - Validates design patterns

**Quality Thresholds:**
- Strict mode: 0.95 (95% score required)
- Moderate mode: 0.85 (85% score required)
- Development mode: 0.75 (75% score required)

### 3. Real Orchestration Mechanisms
**Located:** ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE.md Part 5

Claude-flow provides 5 coordination modes with MCP tools for:
- Swarm monitoring and status
- Memory coordination and knowledge sharing
- Agent management and communication
- Task orchestration with dependencies

### 4. Production-Grade Quality System
**Located:** ARCHITECTURE-DEEP-DIVE.md Part 8

Complete checklist for architecture alignment including:
- Verification system initialization
- Multi-agent consensus patterns
- Memory organization strategies
- Truth scoring and reliability tracking

## üìä Investigation Methodology

**Evidence Sources:**
- ‚úÖ Source code analysis (with line numbers)
- ‚úÖ Runtime behavior testing
- ‚úÖ Implementation verification
- ‚úÖ Documentation cross-comparison
- ‚úÖ CLI command verification
- ‚úÖ MCP tool analysis

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (95%+)

All findings based on direct evidence from:
- `src/cli/simple-commands/verification.js`
- `src/cli/simple-commands/swarm.js`
- `src/cli/simple-commands/sparc/architecture.js`
- Runtime MCP server behavior
- Database schema and storage patterns
