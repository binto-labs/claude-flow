**Institution:** Google Research, Tsinghua University
**Status:** ✅ Validated - All Paper Benchmarks Passed

## Overview

This pre-trained ReasoningBank model implements the key innovations from the Google Research paper, enabling AI agents to learn from both successes AND failures through strategy-level memory patterns. Unlike traditional approaches that memorize task-specific solutions, this model captures high-level reasoning strategies that generalize across domains.

### Key Innovations Implemented

1. **Strategy-Level Memory** (Section 3.1)
   - Distills high-level reasoning strategies, not just task-specific facts
   - Patterns capture the "why" and "how" behind successful approaches
   - Enables transfer learning across similar problem domains

2. **Failure Pattern Learning** (Section 3.2) - **Critical Innovation**
   - Learns from mistakes, not just successes (40% of patterns)
   - Captures what went wrong and why it failed
   - Prevents repeating known failure modes

3. **MaTTS: Multi-Attempt Task Scaling** (Section 3.3)
   - **Parallel Mode**: Generate multiple solutions simultaneously, pick best
   - **Sequential Mode**: Iterative refinement based on feedback
   - Adapts strategy based on problem complexity

4. **Closed-Loop Learning** (Section 3.4)
   - Continuous improvement through experience
   - Patterns evolve based on real-world outcomes
   - Self-correcting through feedback integration

## Paper Methodology

### Strategy-Level vs Task-Level Memory

**Traditional Approach (Task-Level):**
```
"Use CSS selector #login-button to log in"
```

**ReasoningBank Approach (Strategy-Level):**
```
"Chain selector strategies: try CSS → XPath → text-content fallback.
Rationale: CSS selectors break across website versions. Fallback
hierarchy increases robustness from 71% to 94%."
```

### Learning From Failures

The paper's key insight: **failures teach us what NOT to do**, which is as valuable as learning what works.

**Example Failure Pattern:**
```yaml
description: "Assuming synchronous API behavior when operations are actually async"
domain: "api-integration"
outcome_analysis: "Polled too early, got stale data 63% of time.
                   Solution: Implemented webhook callbacks instead."
success_rate: 0.18  # Low rate indicates this is a failure mode to avoid
confidence: 0.92    # High confidence we should NOT do this
```

### MaTTS: Parallel vs Sequential Scaling

**Parallel MaTTS Example:**
```yaml
description: "Generate 5 diverse selector strategies simultaneously,
              use first successful match"
strategy: "parallel"
outcome_analysis: "Parallel attempt with CSS, XPath, text-content, ARIA,
                   data-testid. Success rate: 96% vs 74% sequential."
```

**Sequential MaTTS Example:**
```yaml
description: "Iteratively refine web scraping xpath by analyzing failure patterns"
strategy: "sequential"
outcome_analysis: "Start generic, analyze missed elements, refine selector.
                   Converged to 98% accuracy in 4 iterations."
```

    pl.strength
  FROM patterns p1
  JOIN pattern_links pl ON p1.id = pl.source_id
  JOIN patterns p2 ON pl.target_id = p2.id
  WHERE p1.domain = 'system-design'
  ORDER BY pl.strength DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"
```
