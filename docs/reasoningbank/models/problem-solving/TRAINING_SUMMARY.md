## 🎓 Representative Examples

### Convergent: Production Database Slowdown
```yaml
Problem: Database experiencing intermittent slowdowns every 15 minutes
Reasoning:
  1. Identify symptom: Regular query latency spikes
  2. Gather metrics: CPU, memory, disk I/O
  3. Analyze correlation: Disk I/O spikes align with latency
  4. Investigate: Background checkpoint process
  5. Validate: Checkpoint causes write amplification
  6. Root cause: Aggressive checkpoint frequency
Solution: Increase checkpoint_timeout, async checkpointing, WAL optimization
Outcome: Latency eliminated, 40% performance improvement
Success Rate: 0.92
Tags: root-cause-analysis, database, performance, systematic-debugging
```

### Divergent: Customer Churn Reduction
```yaml
Problem: Need innovative approaches to reduce customer churn
Reasoning:
  - Idea 1: Predictive ML model with proactive outreach
  - Idea 2: Gamification with loyalty rewards
  - Idea 3: Personalized features based on usage
  - Idea 4: Community building with forums
  - Idea 5: Flexible pricing options
  - Idea 6: Early access for loyal users
  - Idea 7: Integration marketplace
  - Idea 8: Educational content series
  - Synthesis: ML + personalization + community
Solution: Multi-faceted retention strategy
Outcome: Churn -32%, lifetime value +45%
Success Rate: 0.85
Tags: divergent, brainstorming, customer-retention, creative
```

### Lateral: Price Competition
```yaml
Problem: Unable to compete on price with larger competitors
Reasoning:
  - Challenge assumption: "Must compete on price"
  - Reframe: Compete on value, not price
  - Lateral shift: Target customers valuing quality
  - Pattern break: Premium positioning vs price matching
  - Insight: Underserved premium market segment
  - Creative leap: Boutique alternative positioning
Solution: Premium positioning, 30% higher prices, white-glove service
Outcome: Revenue +55%, profit margins tripled, retention 94%
Success Rate: 0.87
Tags: lateral, pattern-breaking, business-strategy, positioning
```

### Systems: Code Quality Decline
```yaml
Problem: Code quality declining despite hiring more engineers
Reasoning:
  - System: Team + codebase + processes
  - Map: More engineers → Less oversight per person
  - Feedback loop: Less oversight → Lower quality → More bugs → Firefighting
  - Delays: Issues emerge 3 months after merge
  - Reinforcing: Firefighting reduces review time
  - Leverage: Review process quality vs quantity
Solution: Pair programming, automated gates, architect oversight
Outcome: Quality +45%, bug density -62%, sustainable growth
Success Rate: 0.90
Tags: systems, feedback-loops, code-quality, holistic
```

### Critical: Feature Request Assumption
```yaml
Problem: Team believes users want more features, retention declining
Reasoning:
  1. Assumption: "More features improve retention"
  2. Question evidence: What data supports this?
  3. Challenge logic: Do users ask for more?
  4. Alternative: Could feature bloat cause issues?
  5. Gather data: User interviews show overwhelm
  6. Test: Ship nothing new for 1 month
  7. Invalidate: Retention improved without features
  8. Insight: Users need better core experience
Solution: Freeze features, improve core workflows, reduce complexity
Outcome: Retention +31%, usage depth +45%, NPS +18
Success Rate: 0.88
Tags: critical, assumption-validation, product, user-research
```
