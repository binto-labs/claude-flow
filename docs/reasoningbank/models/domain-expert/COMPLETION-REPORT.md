sqlite3 memory.db "SELECT problem, confidence FROM patterns 
WHERE domain = 'DevOps & Infrastructure' LIMIT 5;"

# Find high-confidence security patterns
sqlite3 memory.db "SELECT problem, solution FROM patterns 
WHERE domain = 'Security & Compliance' AND confidence > 0.90 
ORDER BY confidence DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Cross-domain patterns
sqlite3 memory.db "
SELECT p1.domain as source_domain, p2.domain as target_domain, 
       COUNT(*) as links
FROM pattern_links pl
JOIN patterns p1 ON pl.source_id = p1.id
JOIN patterns p2 ON pl.target_id = p2.id
WHERE p1.domain != p2.domain
GROUP BY p1.domain, p2.domain;
